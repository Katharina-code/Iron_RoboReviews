      "Reviews: Easy Installation This product is great! I’m so happy that i can protect my children from getting into all of our foods on our grocery list, and even items in the freezer like ice cream or other frozen snacks we have stored up there too…so far it’s been easy to install as well. Easy Installation I liked how simple this was! The instructions were clear enough that I didn’t need any help with installing them on my fridge and they worked very well for what i needed, which was keeping all of the kids from opening up our refrigerator everyday without permission or getting into anything we don' t want them to eat. They are quite easy as you can see in this video here: https :// v= 48QZyDj5BGg I would recommend these for anyone who has kids!\n",

      "Reviews: It does nothing and doesn't stay on. I was excited that this worked with our new fridge because of reviews saying it did so we could put locks for small children without having a keyed door...but the one you sent didn’T work at all..we couldn;td even get to open it\n",
      "Reviews: It is not sticky enough. I tried and they came off within minutes when my child pushed them with her hand!
